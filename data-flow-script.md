# Data Flow Script (DFS)
## What is DFS?
The data flow script (DFS) is the underlying text, similar to a coding language, that is used to execute the transformations that are included in a mapping data flow. Every transformation is represented by a series of properties that provide the necessary information to run the job properly. For instance, 

## Use cases
The DFS is usually hidden from users and is automatically produced by the user interface. As a result, most of the time reading or editing the DFS directly is unnecessary. There are some cases, though, where it can be helpful or necessary to have an understanding of the script to help with debugging and producing data flows.

Here are a few examples:
- Programatically producing many data flows that are fairly similar
- Complex expressions that are difficult to manage in the UI or are resulting in validation issues
- Debugging and better understanding various errors returned during execution
